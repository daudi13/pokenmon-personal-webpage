                <h2>Pikachu</h2>
                <p>Pikachu[c] is a electric-type species of Pokémon, fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of video games, television shows, movies, trading card games, and comic books licensed by The Pokémon Company. It is a yellow mouse-like creature with powerful electrical abilities. In most vocalized appearances, including the anime and certain video games, it is primarily voiced by Ikue Ōtani. A Pikachu also appears as part of the main cast in the live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu, played in CGI and voiced by Ryan Reynolds.

The Pikachu design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori.[2] Pikachu first appeared in Pokémon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pokémon video games, Pokémon Red and Blue, for the original Game Boy.

Pikachu is the best-known species of Pokémon, largely because Pikachu is a central character (starter Pokémon of Ash) in the Pokémon anime series. Pikachu is a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years and one of the major mascots for Nintendo.</p>

<h3>Concept and design</h3>
<p>Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called "Pokémon" that players, called "trainers", are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pokémon or interact with the game's world.[3] Pikachu was one of several different Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team. Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's design,[4][5] which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori.[6][7] According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the name is derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds: pika, a sound an electric spark makes, and chu, a sound a mouse makes.[8] Despite its name's origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's generation 1 design, especially its cheeks, on squirrels.[9] Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences.[10]

Standing 40 centimetres (1 ft 4 in) tall, Pikachu was the first "Electric-type" Pokémon created, their design intended to revolve around the concept of electricity.[11] They appear as Pika-like[citation needed] creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt-shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity.[12] In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu now has an indent at the end of its tail, giving it a heart-shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or "evolve," into a Raichu when exposed to a "Thunder Stone." In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named "Pichu", which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer.</p>
<p>Initially both Pikachu and the Pokémon Clefairy were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more "engaging". However, with the production of the animated series, Pikachu was chosen as the primary mascot, in an attempt to appeal to female viewers and their mothers, and because it was believed that Pikachu presented the image of a recognizable intimate pet to children. Its color was also a deciding factor, as yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance, and with consideration to the fact that the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh.[13] </p>
